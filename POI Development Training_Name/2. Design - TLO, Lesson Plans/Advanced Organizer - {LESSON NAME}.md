**1.**  **Learning Objective**

| **Action** (W_hat students will know or be able to do at the end of the lesson.):_
1. Interpret What Makes a Passphrase Resistant to Cracking.
2. Produce a Cracking-Resistant Passphrase
 |
| --- |
| **Condition** (_What is provided or withheld from students during training):_
Given a block of instruction, one (1) notecard per student, a writing board, Instruction Slides, and a Computer with Access to https://timcutting.co.uk/
 |
| **Standard** (This describes how well the student must complete the action.):

1. C-2 Interpret what makes a password resistant to cyber-attacks with a score of 100% on the importance of length to account authentication.
2. C-3 Produce a passphrase resistant to cyber-attacks of over 16 characters and over 35% or ~84 bits entropy using one of the following resources:
  - [https://timcutting.co.uk/tools/password-entropy](https://timcutting.co.uk/tools/password-entropy)
  - E = L \* log2(R).
    - _E is entropy, L is length, R is unique characters_
 |
| **Audience** : Personnel Familiar with Creating Accounts Online |
| **Training Resources Required** : Writing Board, Time Keeping Device, Instruction Slides, Computer with Access to https://timcutting.co.uk/tools/password-entropy
 |

**Learning Level:** (_May not necessarily be one from each domain__.)_

**(Cognitive Domain – Listed below from the lowest level to the highest level)**

**Knowledge – Recall or recognize information**

**Comprehension – Understand meaning**

**Application – Use or apply knowledge**

**Analysis – Interpret structure, elements or relationships**

**Synthesis – Create or build**

**Evaluation – Assess or judge in relational terms**

2. **Experiential Learning Model (ELM)** Generally _describe what you will do in each step and/or give sample questions if appropriate (i.e., P&P and Develop). Also, as you work your way through the ELM steps consider how much time you will spend in each step, realizing that some steps take longer than others._

| _**TIME:03 - Concrete Experience (CE) Student Centered (SC)**_

1. _Hand out one (1) notecard to each student_
2. _Instruct students to create the following_
  1. _One pin which they consider to be strong_
  2. _One password which they consider to be weak_
  3. _One password which is not their real password and which they consider to be strong._
3. _Collect the notecards from each student_
4. _write a complex password on the writing board_
5. _Ask students to remember this password_
6. _Ask students who remember their strong password and confirm?_

 |
| --- |
| _**TIME:02 – Publish and Process (P&P) SC, Instructor Managed (facilitated)**_
1. _Ask students "what was difficult about remembering their password"_
2. _Introduce the learning objectives_
**(**NOTE: You should **transition** to GNI based on something that is said in P&P. For example: "That's a great point and ties in well with our focus today"…followed by introducing the learning objective where you tell participants what they will be able to do when you finish.) Introduce the Lesson Objective at GNI. |
| _**TIME:05 – Generalize New Information (GNI) Instructor Centered**_
1. _Go over visual graphic on the speed of cracking passwords_
2. _Compare and contrast the previous guidance for creating complex passwords_
3. _Demonstrate how secure and memorable passphrases are_

 |
| _**TIME:01 – Develop (Future Use) SC, Instructor Managed (facilitated)**_
1. _Ask students how they will use this technique?_

 |
| _**TIME:01 – Apply (example: practical exercises, exam, etc.) Student Centered**_
1. _Ask students to write a strong passphrase on the board._
(Note: At the conclusion of the Apply you must provide feedback, and then you should have some sort of closing or wrap-up of the lesson.) |
